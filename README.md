### What is the paper about?

This paper provides an analysis of three data sets from the NYC Open Data program to explore the relationships between building complaints, evictions, and storefront vacancy rates from 2019-2021 in the New York City (NYC) area. This analysis can be used by city officials and real estate professionals to make informed decisions about policies and investments to address building complaints, evictions, and storefront vacancies in the NYC area. 
In the report we aggregate the data based on zip code and year and performs linear regression analysis to understand the trends and patterns. The paper begins by introducing the data sets and the specific columns that will be used. It also outlines the assumptions made and the limitations of the data. The paper then presents the findings from the analysis, including histograms, heatmaps, and tables, to provide insights into the patterns and trends of building complaints, evictions, and storefront vacancies in the NYC area. Finally we build a linear regression model to pin down the relationship between number of complaints with number of evictions and vacancies.
